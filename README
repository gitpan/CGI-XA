=head1 DESCRIPTION

I have started with major hacks on top of Lincoln's version 2.23 of
CGI.pm in order to get rid of both AUTOLOADING and uncontrolled
global variables.

I release this package as CGI::XA (which stands for "for Apache")
for a limited audience as a test case.

This software is alpha software and it is not clear if it will be
supported for a longer time. My preferred solution would be, Lincoln
accepts all the changes and continues with his excellent work.

=head2 where are the main differences?

    No AUTOLOAD
    use strict clean
    no exports
    no cgi-lib.pl compatibility
    no "Q" namespace

=head2 BUGS

With this code I cannot use the file upload feature as expected. Only
the first file upload within a the life of a server is guaranteed to
work. Also ok are small files < 2k (haven't tested the exact limit
where things go astray).
